# Homelab system

This project encapsulates the hardware / server level setup of my homelab via ansible.

Captured in this repo are the details relating to the underlying Debian and k3s installation, setup of prometheus node-exporters, local development scripts, etc.

The sister project exists under a corresponding `homelab-application` repo, which manages applications deployed within the k3s cluster.
